# Digital Forensics Lab ‚Äì Multimedia Data Hiding (CYB-642)

This project documents a graduate-level digital forensics lab conducted as part of Utica University's MS in Cybersecurity program. The focus was on identifying and extracting hidden data from multimedia files using industry-standard tools and techniques relevant to modern forensic investigations.

## üîç Objectives
- Perform steganographic data extraction from MP3 audio files using a provided Python script
- Analyze recovered image anomalies using visual filters in StegoAnalyst
- Use WinHex for binary inspection and image carving
- Simulate hidden volume creation and encryption using TrueCrypt
- Document findings using chain-of-custody principles and formal forensic reporting standards

## üõ† Tools Used
- **StegoAnalyst** ‚Äì to examine image pixel data for hidden content
- **WinHex** ‚Äì for hex-level file analysis and carving
- **TrueCrypt** ‚Äì to simulate creation of hidden encrypted volumes
- **Python (`pyMP3.py`)** ‚Äì used for MP3 steganography analysis (instructor-provided script)
- **Windows CLI** ‚Äì for file operations and script execution
